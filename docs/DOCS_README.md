# Documentation Maintenance Overview

The documentation found in this directory is hosted at:

- https://tendermint.com/docs/

and built using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) from the tendermint website repo:

- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.com

which has a [configuration file](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.com/blob/develop/docs/.vuepress/config.js) for displaying
the Table of Contents that lists all the documentation.

The `README.md` in this directory is the landing page for
website documentation and the following folders are intentionally
ommitted:

- `architecture/` ==> contains Architecture Design Records
- `spec/` ==> contains the detailed specification
