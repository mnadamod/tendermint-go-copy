CONSENT TO JOINT REPRESENTATION AND WAIVER OF CONFIDENTIALITY 

1. The Purpose of This Document 

a. Joint Representation 

You, the undersigned, Jehan Tremback and Jae Kwon (“You”), have requested representation from Alice Townes (the “Attorney”) in discussion, drafting and execution of the Profit Allocation Agreement. There may be potential conflicts of interest in the representation of more than one party to a contract negotiation. This Consent and Waiver is to inform You of such potential conflicts of interest, and to obtain Your informed consent in writing. 

In the present matter, You have requested legal assistance with respect to the Profit Allocation Agreement. It is understood that the pricing and negotiation of the Profit Allocation Agreement has been determined and that the economics of the transaction are not under discussion. The terms of the agreement are still open to negotiation. It is understood that the remaining terms are mutually beneficial or neutral (not adversarial). 

When the same attorney represents two or more persons on the same side of a single negotiation, areas of conflict may arise during the representation. For example, the clients may have different goals regarding the terms of the agreement. Attorney will represent both of You in this matter as long as there is no conflict as to how the negotiation should proceed. This includes specific language drafted in the agreement. If one of You gives Attorney notice that the terms of the agreement are adversarial and cause an actual conflict of interest, then Attorney will inform and advise each of You that an actual conflict has arisen. At that point, one or both of You may decide to seek the advice of another attorney, to try to resolve the conflict and agree upon joint instructions to Attorney, or to discontinue Attorney’s dual representation.
 
Attorney is willing to represent each of You in this matter, provided that each of You acknowledge the potential that a conflict of interest may arise, and consent to Attorney’s representation of each of You despite the potential for conflict. 

b. Client Confidentiality 

Under most circumstances, an attorney who represents a client is obligated to keep all communications with his or her client confidential. That is, the attorney cannot tell other people about the contents of his or her conversations with his or her client(s). This is called the “attorney-client privilege.” 

When an attorney represents more than one client in the same negotiation, however, the attorney must be able to tell one client what the other client said with regard to matters related to the subject of the joint representation. For example, during contract negotiations, the attorney must be able to tell one client what the other thinks about a particular term of the contract. 

Therefore, Attorney asks that each of You waive Your right to confidentiality as to the other of You in this matter. Your waiver concerns the confidentiality of communications to the other of You in this matter only, not as to any other persons, such as opposing parties or other third parties. 

c. Duty of Loyalty 

An attorney owes a duty of loyalty to his or her client. In a case of joint representation, this duty of loyalty is owed to each of the jointly represented clients. A conflict of interest may exist if Attorney’s loyalty to one of You causes Attorney to limit Attorney’s advocacy for the other one of You in any way with respect to this matter. In the event of such a conflict of interest, Attorney will notify You and discuss possible ways to proceed. 

2. Client Agreement to Joint Representation and Waiver of Confidentiality 

Each of You have read or had the opportunity to read the foregoing statements and You each have been informed by Attorney of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise in this matter and of the consequences should an actual conflict arise. Each of You consents to Attorney’s joint representation of You regarding the matter described above. You understand that due to this joint representation, a conflict of interest may arise in the future. 

Each of You agrees to waive Your respective right to attorney-client confidentiality as to the other of You regarding the matter described above. You authorize Attorney to discuss communications between each of You and Attorney with the other of You who has signed this Consent and Waiver. In signing this Consent and Waiver, You are not waiving Your respective rights to attorney-client confidentiality as to any other person or entity other than the other of You. 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (digital or physical), each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
